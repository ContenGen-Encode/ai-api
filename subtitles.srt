00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,720
A dimly lit bedroom, the camera slowly pans across a desk cluttered with books and an

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:07,100
old clock ticking faintly.

3
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:12,420
She moved into the house just last week, charmed by its vintage feel and quiet neighborhood.

4
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:18,620
But every night, at exactly 2.47am, she woke up to the sound of faint knocking.

5
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:20,860
Three slow, deliberate taps.

6
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:23,719
It always came from the wall behind her headboard.

7
00:00:23,719 --> 00:00:28,139
At first, she chalked it up to the house settling or pipes creaking.

8
00:00:28,139 --> 00:00:31,299
She even tried shoving her bed closer to the middle of the room.

9
00:00:31,299 --> 00:00:32,779
But nothing stopped it.

10
00:00:32,779 --> 00:00:36,459
Last night, determined to find the source, she stayed awake.

11
00:00:36,459 --> 00:00:39,779
Her phone's clock blinked 2.46am.

12
00:00:39,779 --> 00:00:41,419
Silence pressed in around her.

13
00:00:41,419 --> 00:00:44,740
Then, as the minute turned, the knocking began.

14
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:47,820
She pressed her ear to the wall, her heart pounding.

15
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:49,060
That's when she heard it.

16
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:52,740
A voice, muffled and strained, whispering her name.

17
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:54,400
It came from inside the wall.

18
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:55,540
She didn't sleep.

19
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:58,779
This morning, she called a contractor to inspect it.

20
00:00:58,779 --> 00:01:01,580
He pulled back the paneling, revealing a hollow space.

21
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:07,419
Inside, they found an old, dust-covered photograph of a woman who looked just like her.

22
00:01:07,419 --> 00:01:10,339
On the back, scrawled in shaky handwriting, were the words,

23
00:01:10,339 --> 00:01:12,339
I've been waiting.

24
00:01:12,339 --> 00:01:13,459
Scene fades to black.
